问题描述：
shop项目运行初始化casbin创建表时， 报字符集错误问题

解决方法：
mysql> drop database gotest;
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> create database gotest default character set=utf8;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

如果用 alter database 方式， 不生效， 可能原因docker 里的服务不能重启：
root@831da969d562:/# vi /etc/mysql/my.cnf
bash: vi: command not found
root@831da969d562:/# cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf

容器内重启服务：
root@831da969d562:/#  /etc/init.d/mysql  restart
[info] Stopping MySQL Community Server 5.7.29.
....

结果容器不在了：
[user1@141-node ~]$ docker ps
